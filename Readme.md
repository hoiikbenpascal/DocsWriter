# Readme
This is a small project i created when I had some time to kill
Right now it creates a markdown file based on the summary and paramaters of public functions in C#

## Note
I know this probably already exists but i wanted to make it myself for fun

## Refer
Refer to the [TestFileMd](TestFile.md) to see the result and to [TestFileCs](TestFile.cs) to see the C# code

## Working
This code uses the xaml summary provided by the C# as well as the paramaters and name of the function in the C# code to create a markdown file of the functions
